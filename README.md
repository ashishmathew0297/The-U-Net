# The U-Nets

This project is a dive into the U-net architecture from scratch in Pytorch, based on the paper from 2015. I will be studying the outputs of the network at each layer and going in-depth into the explanation of how this network works.

The original paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)
